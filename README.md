# OneWay

OneWay is a swift package providing libraries to implement and test a unidirectional architecture pattern without any external dependencies (e.g., Combine, etc.). It only makes use of the newly introduced concurrency features of swift.

**Note**: This package is currently a work in progress and might not perform as expected.
